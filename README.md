# Redshift-visualisation

A graphical visualisation of gravitational redshift caused by time dilation and consequently, how it affects percieved data waves

-Main excecutables are located in bin/{your os}/

-----------
### Output

1st is a **normal EM wave**

2nd is **with the time dilation** factor obtained from our results

3rd is **65% time dilation factor** i.e wave is slowed down 1.54 times 2nd wave
